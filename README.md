# Water Sort Puzzle prototype

Idea:

Try new game mechanics.

Features:

-   Classic mode: 2-10 colors in tubes of equal size containing 3-8 balls (portions) each. Gather all balls in their own tubes to win.
-   Uno mode: the same as classic except that you have to gather only one color to win. Makes playing with large tubes (volume 5+) faster and easier.
-   Fog of War mode: can be set and tried with both previous modes. All the balls except the top in each tube are hidden until you make them top. In Uno mode the balls of the winning color are also visible.

The game is build with TS and Phaser 3 and based on Arsen Mazmanyan's [starting template](https://github.com/arsenmazmanyan/phaser3-starting-template).
